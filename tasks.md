    echo "❌ Error: No design files found for issue: $issue_name"  
    echo "📋 Required files pattern: tasks/$issue_name/03-*.md"
    echo "🔧 Run design.md first to create technical specifications"
    exit 1
fi

# Incomplete previous phases
for phase in "${required_phases[@]}"; do
    phase_files=($(ls tasks/$issue_name/$phase-*.md 2>/dev/null))
    if [ ${#phase_files[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "❌ Error: Phase $phase incomplete"
        echo "📋 Workflow order: concept → requirements → design → tasks"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

## Integration Points
- **Previous Phases**: Reads all documentation from concept, requirements, and design phases
- **Next Phase**: `implement.md` will read all `04-*.md` task files for execution
- **Quality Assurance**: Task definitions include built-in quality gates
- **Documentation**: Creates multiple specialized documents for comprehensive planning

## Tips for Success
1. **Granular Tasks**: Break complex work into manageable chunks  
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Identify and document all prerequisite relationships
3. **Parallel Opportunities**: Find tasks that can be developed simultaneously
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk tasks early and plan mitigation
5. **Quality Gates**: Build testing and validation into the task structure
