# Tasks - Phase 4: Task Breakdown & Implementation Planning

## Purpose
Break down design specifications into granular, implementable tasks with clear dependencies, priorities, and detailed implementation guidance.

## Usage
```bash
/tasks
```

## Input Parameters
- **Issue name**: `<issue-name>` (will prompt if not provided)

## Prerequisites Check
- **REQUIRED**: All files from phases 1-3
- **Pattern**: `tasks/<issue-name>/01-*.md`, `tasks/<issue-name>/02-*.md`, `tasks/<issue-name>/03-*.md`

## Validation Logic
```bash
# Validate issue name provided
if [ -z "$issue_name" ]; then
    echo "Enter issue name for task breakdown phase:"
    read -p "Issue name: " issue_name
fi

# Check all required phases
required_phases=("01" "02" "03")
for phase in "${required_phases[@]}"; do
    phase_files=($(ls tasks/$issue_name/$phase-*.md 2>/dev/null))
    if [ ${#phase_files[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
        phase_name=""
        case $phase in
            "01") phase_name="concept" ;;
            "02") phase_name="requirements" ;;
            "03") phase_name="design" ;;
        esac
        echo "‚ùå Error: Phase $phase ($phase_name) incomplete for issue: $issue_name"
        echo "üìã Missing files pattern: tasks/$issue_name/$phase-*.md"
        echo "üîß Complete missing phase: $phase_name.md"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Load all documentation files
echo "‚úÖ Prerequisites validated. Loading documentation..."
all_docs=($(ls tasks/$issue_name/{01,02,03}-*.md 2>/dev/null))
echo "üìÑ Found ${#all_docs[@]} documentation files"
for doc in "${all_docs[@]}"; do
    echo "  - $(basename $doc)"
done
```

## Process

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation Analysis
```bash
# Read and analyze all previous phase documents
echo "üìñ Analyzing comprehensive project documentation..."

# Load concept for context
concept_content=$(cat "tasks/$issue_name/01-concept.md")

# Load all requirements documents
requirements_files=($(ls tasks/$issue_name/02-*.md))
echo "üìã Analyzing ${#requirements_files[@]} requirements documents"

# Load all design documents  
design_files=($(ls tasks/$issue_name/03-*.md))
echo "üé® Analyzing ${#design_files[@]} design documents"

# Detect complexity indicators
ui_complexity=$(grep -i "wireframe\|animation\|interaction\|responsive" tasks/$issue_name/03-*.md | wc -l)
api_complexity=$(grep -i "endpoint\|api\|service\|integration" tasks/$issue_name/03-*.md | wc -l)
db_complexity=$(grep -i "database\|schema\|migration\|data model" tasks/$issue_name/03-*.md | wc -l)

echo "üîç Complexity Analysis:"
echo "  - UI/UX complexity: $ui_complexity indicators"
echo "  - API/Service complexity: $api_complexity indicators" 
echo "  - Database complexity: $db_complexity indicators"
```
