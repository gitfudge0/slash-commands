# Requirements - Phase 2: Requirements Documentation & Specification

## Purpose
Transform concept into detailed, structured requirements following industry best practices with comprehensive user stories, acceptance criteria, and functional specifications.

## Usage
```bash
/requirements
```

## Input Parameters
- **Issue name**: `<issue-name>` (will prompt if not provided)

## Prerequisites Check
- **REQUIRED**: `tasks/<issue-name>/01-concept.md`
- **OPTIONAL**: `tasks/<issue-name>/00-project-context.md` (from doc-generator)

## Validation Logic
```bash
# Validate issue name provided
if [ -z "$issue_name" ]; then
    echo "Enter issue name for requirements phase:"
    read -p "Issue name: " issue_name
fi

# Check required prerequisite files
required_file="tasks/$issue_name/01-concept.md"
if [ ! -f "$required_file" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Concept phase incomplete for issue: $issue_name"
    echo "📝 Required file missing: $required_file"
    echo "💡 Run: concept.md with issue name '$issue_name'"
    exit 1
fi

# Check optional context file
context_file="tasks/$issue_name/00-project-context.md"
if [ -f "$context_file" ]; then
    echo "📄 Found project context: $context_file"
    has_context=true
else
    echo "ℹ️ No project context found (optional)"
    echo "💡 Consider running: doc-generator.md for better context"
    has_context=false
fi

echo "✅ Prerequisites validated. Reading concept document..."
```

## Process

### 1. Concept Analysis & Context Loading
```bash
# Read and analyze concept document
echo "📖 Analyzing concept document..."
concept_content=$(cat "tasks/$issue_name/01-concept.md")

# Read project context if available
if [ "$has_context" = true ]; then
    echo "📖 Loading project context..."
    context_content=$(cat "tasks/$issue_name/00-project-context.md")
fi

# Extract key information for requirements gathering
echo "🔍 Extracting key information from concept..."
```

## Error Handling
```bash
# Missing concept document
if [ ! -f "tasks/$issue_name/01-concept.md" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Concept phase incomplete for issue: $issue_name"
    echo "📋 Missing: tasks/$issue_name/01-concept.md"
    echo "🔧 Solution: Run concept.md with issue name '$issue_name'"
    echo ""
    echo "Workflow order: concept.md → requirements.md → design.md → tasks.md → implement.md"
    exit 1
fi

# Invalid issue name or directory issues
if [ ! -d "tasks/$issue_name" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Issue directory not found: tasks/$issue_name"
    echo "💡 Tip: Issue names should match those created in concept phase"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Integration Points
- **Previous Phase**: Reads `tasks/<issue-name>/01-concept.md` for context
- **Next Phase**: `design.md` will read all `02-*.md` requirement files
- **Optional Context**: Uses `00-project-context.md` if available
- **Quality Check**: Can be validated with quality assessment tools

## Tips for Success
1. **Be Comprehensive**: Cover all functional and non-functional aspects
2. **Think User-Centered**: Focus on user needs and workflows
3. **Define Measurable Criteria**: Ensure testable acceptance conditions
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Plan for error conditions and exceptions
5. **Document Assumptions**: Make implicit requirements explicit
6. **Visual Communication**: Use diagrams and wireframes for clarity

## Example Workflow
```bash
# Start requirements phase
./requirements.md

# System validates prerequisites
✅ Prerequisites validated. Reading concept document...

# System loads context and begins interactive questioning
📖 Analyzing concept document for 'google-oauth-integration'
🔍 Starting comprehensive requirements gathering...

# After thorough interactive session
✅ Requirements documentation complete:
  - tasks/google-oauth-integration/02-requirements.md
  - tasks/google-oauth-integration/02-stakeholder-matrix.md  
  - tasks/google-oauth-integration/02-user-stories.md
  - tasks/google-oauth-integration/02-acceptance-criteria.md

Next: Run design.md with issue name 'google-oauth-integration'
```
